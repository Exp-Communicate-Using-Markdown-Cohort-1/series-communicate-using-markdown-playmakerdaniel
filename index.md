# Adding Headers using GitHub Markdown Language
## Provided by GitHub Education
### By Daniel Burrows
### MarkDown is a language that is used to provide information to the repository, specifically in the READ.me file in a repo.
#### By including MarkDown in your repo, you will be able to better communicate to anyone reading your READ.me how to download the repository and any important functions that are required and that should be noted about.
##### Having a firm understanding of how MarkDown works and what it is used for will greatly benefit anyone who wants to develop and share repositories with others in their career.
